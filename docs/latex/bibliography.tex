\begin{description}
	\item \citep{CalafioreGhaoui2014} is a self-contained book. It presents the concepts of linear algebra used in the book. The book starts by with linear optimisation moving to cone and semidefinite optimisation. It also contains an introduction to solving algorithms and applications to machine learning, finance, control and engineering;
	
	\item \citep{Clarke:2013} is a more theoretical book. It contains elements of functional analysis, nonsmooth analysis and optimisation (generalised gradients). The generality of the optimisation formulation is achieved with the use of calculus of variations;
	
	\item \citep{Liberzon2012} is a comprehensive book on the optimisation. It starts the book by introducing finite and infinite-dimensional optimisation problems. The next subject is the calculus of variations, and optimal control.
